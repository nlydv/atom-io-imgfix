# A very niche chrome extension
Browsing through Atom's online package & theme repositories to find a suitiable plugin got on my nerves.

Ever since I started using Atom, the images on the site have been broken.

## Installation

Install via chrome's webstore at [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/atomio-%E2%80%94-image-fixer/dckhejcdhaojgaafhjmeengkkilgejma) or DIY:

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to Chrome's extension manager
3. Click 'load unpacked' and select the cloned repo
4. Observe working images
5. Rejoice

## How it works
Turns out all the original image links were embeded in the html elements already.

## A dedicated browser extension seems like overkill
Yeah it probably is.

I've literally only written one functional Javascript file before this. Surprising how long such a glaringly obvious bug, with a simple fix, goes seemingly unnoticed.
